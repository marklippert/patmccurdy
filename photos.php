Are you Instagramming your time at a Pat show? If so, tag them with "patmccurdy" and they'll be added to the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/patmccurdy/">Pat stream</a>.  Much more timlier than sending them to our lazy-ass webmaster who never gets around to putting them up on this site.
