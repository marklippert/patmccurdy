<h5>Biography</h5>
Milwaukee icon Pat McCurdy has been entertaining audiences in Wisconsin, the Midwest, and across the nation for decades. He brings his unique style of improvisational comedy, music and audience interaction to venues large and small. Pat consistently fills up venues and festivals with his fans, known as "Patheads. They are very enthusiastic, and many know every word of his songs. "Patheads" are fans that have seen him dozens of times, singing and dancing along to every song. It's a fun show for all.<br>
<br>

Pat did not let the pandemic slow him down. In March 2020, Pat began his weekly virtual "Shelter in Place" shows from his living room and garage. Fans wrote in requests, birthday greetings, and anniversary acknowledgements to keep the shows interactive. Pat's Shelter in Place shows have been seen by nearly one million viewers from as far away as Paris, the UK and Australia. The pandemic inspired Pat to write a new song every week. He put these all together in his latest CD, <em>Now is Not the Time for Sad Songs: A Pandemic 2020 Souvenir</em>. The CD hit #1 on the Worldwide Radio Indie Alliance Album of the Year charts.<br>
<br>

For fans far and wide, Pat will continue his virtual show once a month until the end of his career. Pat can be seen all over Wisconsin and the Midwest for live shows year around throughout 2021 and beyond. Grab your favorite beverage and have fun with Pat and Sex and Beer!<br>
